%% The basic format of the poster is to create text boxes with the
%% various things you want to display.  You can then play around 
%% with how to lay thing out.  In the old version of this template,
%% the content was always provided with alternatives suitable for
%% printing on sheets of paper (resizing fonts, images, etc).  I
%% think that's too confusing to read.  The old layout was:
%%     \ifposter
%%          some poster commands go here
%%     \else
%%          an alternative style here in case you are printing on
%%          regular sheets of paper
%%     \fi
%% One option is to make the entire poster and then wrap it in an \ifposter
%% and then make all the slides separately.  This seems to be easier
%% if your poster is not much like a bunch of 8.5x11 sheet tacked together
%% in the first place.

Low-rate denial-of-service(LRD) attacks are often hard to detect at the network level as they consume little bandwidth. It is the intricacies in the payloads and the dynamics of the attack traffic that induces denial-of-service on servers when processed by specific hardware and software.

We introduce \textbf{Leader, a hybrid approach for application-agnostic and attack-agnostic detection and mitigation of LRD attacks.} Leader operates by \textbf{learning normal patterns of network, application and system-level resources} when processing legitimate external requests. It relies on a \textbf{novel combination of runtime, system and network monitoring and offline binary program analysis.}

Monitoring and system overview: \textbf{Novelty of our approach lies in our connection life stages and code path abstractions, which are built from monitoring the system at network, OS and application levels.} Figure \ref{fig:monitor} shows a high-level view of the abstraction levels at which Leader operates. It also illustrates the trade-offs between accuracy of semantic reasoning and, monitoring cost and delay. OS-level instrumentation allows an observer to gain more insights about the applicationâ€™s semantics and program analysis offers the highest level of semantic reasoning. Figure \ref{fig:overview} gives the system overview. LRD attacks usually involve several incoming service requests arriving at the server that are expensive/slow processing leading to resource depletion.

\redhead{Preliminary Results}
%Analyzing programs at the binary level involves some \textbf{challenges}. Compared to source-level analysis, the amount of \textbf{semantic information} available from the disassembly of binary code is \textbf{limited}. The following describes some of these challenges.

We relied on on Emulab to experiment with Slowloris, a common type of low-rate denial-of-service attack. We set up a static Web server, and used 10 legitimate and one attack client. The legitimate clients continuously requested the main Web page, using wget, each 200 ms. This created 50 requests per second at the server. The attack client opened 1,000 simultaneous attack connections and kept them open for as long as possible by sending never-ending headers on each. This had negative impact on legitimate clients, that had trouble establishing connection with the server. Figure \ref{fig:slowloris} shows the life stage diagram for traffic in attack case, which includes both legitimate
and attack connections, and compared it to the diagram in the baseline case. The highlighted stages differ between two cases and help us identify anomalous connections.

\begin{tcolorbox}[boxsep=10pt,colback=green!1!white]

Another novel aspect of Leader lies in the structures it uses to capture sequences of resource-use events in a temporal and relational manner per each incoming service request. These sequences are known as \textbf{connection life stages}. 
%%They are built from multiple, complementary observations collected at the (1) network level, (2) OS level and (3) application level. The connection life stages are then clustered into typical resource-use patterns, or profiles for applications and for users.

During normal operation, it learns the legitimate behavior of the connections, applications, clients and the device where it is deployed and signals an attack by comparing the  instantaneous profiles to corresponding baseline profiles and identifies troubled services.

	We are working on \textbf{Systemtap} to build aggregate profiles of an application's/system's resource usage pattern for each connection at the system call level. We capture the time spent on each system call and the resources used by them such as memory usage, number of page faults and open file descriptors, cpu cycles and other thread/process level details. We do such profiling for both legitimate traffic as well as attack traffic. There are notable differences between the two. We will utilize these profiles, along with other sophistication, to detect attacks and mitigate them.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Behavior profiling}
\\
\\LEADER relies on the collection of measures and statistics of system resourcesâ€™ usage for successful attack detection. These measures are collected per each incoming service request and comprise observations at the network, system and application level. Leader captures the connection, client, application and whole-device profiles at all times. During normal operation, Leader performs profiling to learn the legitimate behavior of the connections, applications, clients and the device where it is deployed.\\
		\item \textbf{ Attack detection (and characterization)}
		\\
		\\Another novel aspect of leader is that it uses a hybrid detection approach combining network security mechanisms with OS and program-level aspects. Our attack detection module compares instantaneous profiles to corresponding baseline profiles, with the goal of detecting evidence of troubled services that have low instantaneous percentages of successfully served incoming requests, compared to the historical (baseline) percentages of successfully served request.\\
		\item \textbf{Attack mitigation}
		\\
		\\Leader deploys a combination of attack mitigation approaches that includes (1) Derivation of the attack signature from attack connections (2) Costly connection termination, (3) Blacklisting of attack sources, (4) Dynamic resource
replication, (5) Program patching and algorithm modification, and (6) Blacklisting of sources with anomalous profiles.\\
